        Since I dipped my toes in the world of coding, I have worked nonstop to learn, grow my skills, and create projects. What excites me most about being a Software Engineer is being able to design and create things that have purpose and solve real problems. Leaning into front and back end, using javascript, react, nosql, and more to find the right problems to solve, delivering that value as quickly as possible, learning from it and then iterating and improving that value over time is the key to user friendly programs. Below are a couple of projects I have authored alone and some in which I have collaborated with an incredible team to create.
